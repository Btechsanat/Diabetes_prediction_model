# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses the *PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset* to build machine learning models that predict whether a person has diabetes based on diagnostic features like glucose level, BMI, age, and more.

## Dataset

- *Source:*(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
- *Features:*
  - Pregnancies
  - Glucose
  - Blood Pressure
  - Skin Thickness
  - Insulin
  - BMI
  - Diabetes Pedigree Function
  - Age
- *Target:* Outcome (1 = Diabetic, 0 = Non-Diabetic)
